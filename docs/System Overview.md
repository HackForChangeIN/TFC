TFC
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tools For Change is built as a platform, that can support other organizations with the voluntereing, fundraising tools that we ourselves would need.

    - Every Partner Organization that comes through HFC has all the features provided by TFC available to them.
    - Ex: Every Patner Organizaation created under hfc will have dedicated home like ex: http://factly.forchange.in
    - This would allow the partner organization to better engage their community as well
    - May be in the future we can give them a way directly to submit problem statements to HFC
    - Webpages in this module are accessible thorugh https://www.forchange.in domain only

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Screening
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - Screening App has the barebones screening invitation and the screening submission and screening managment which is used by TFC for screening purposes.
    - We can choose to extract this out in the future if we want this to be a standalone app.
    - Web pages in the module are rootless. 
    - Ex: If the importing module is volunteer the screenig url will be under volunteer name space.
      If the importing module is under employee url will be under employee name space.
